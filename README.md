I make two views, one for mobile/tablet(mobile) and other desktop, I don't have the breakpoints I put it on 900px.

I only make a one example test.

The view isn't pixel perfect because i haven't a tool similar like Zeplin to see the styles.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
