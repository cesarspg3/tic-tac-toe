This is an example of three in a row game with React/Typescript and node without typescript

# Deploy app

First you must run `npm install` on ./ and ./server

the ./server folder is the part of node.

Next you can run this commands:

Run back with front: `npm start`

Only the front: `npm run front`

Only the back (with debug in chrome): `npm run back`

Run tests `npm test`


// TO DO I don't separate the api calls in other folder
